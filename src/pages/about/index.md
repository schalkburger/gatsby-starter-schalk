Skateboarder, tattoo addict, drummer, vintage furniture lover and communicator, collector, connector, creator. Performing at the sweet spot between beauty and programing to craft experiences that go beyond design. I work with Fortune 500 companies and startups.

My work explores the relationship between postmodern discourse and UFO sightings. With influences as diverse as Caravaggio and Miles Davis, new insights are created from both constructed and discovered dialogues.

Ever since I was a postgraduate I have been fascinated by the traditional understanding of relationships. What starts out as yearning soon becomes corrupted into a cacophony of defeat, leaving only a sense of decadence and the prospect of a new reality.

As shifting replicas become reconfigured through boundaried and diverse practice, the viewer is left with a testament to the darkness of our world.
